**A website to control the school's bells using Django**

At my school, music plays through the intercom in between classes. The problem is that the only way to get a song you like played is by giving a CD to the office. So, in an attempt to learn Django, I'm going to try to make a website that students can use to get their songs played.

***Foreseeable Issues:***  
    I don't know Django very well  
    I have very little experience in web design  
    The legality of it all (piracy??)  
    I don't know how to use GitHub  
    *and many more...*
